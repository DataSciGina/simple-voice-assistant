# Simple Voice Agent

A lightweight voice‑driven AI assistant built using Python and Streamlit. This project leverages Ollama, Mistral, and LangChain to process and generate intelligent responses, while enabling user interaction via voice through the speech_recognition library. The interface is powered by Streamlit, offering an intuitive, browser‑based experience. Users simply clone the repository, install dependencies, and launch the assistant with streamlit run ai_voice_agent.py to begin interactive voice sessions. 

## How to use it

Open the bash in the folder you want to save the agent.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/DataSciGina/simple-voice-assistant.git
cd ./simple-voice-assistant
pip install
streamlit run ./ai_voice_agent.py
```

And start talking with it!
